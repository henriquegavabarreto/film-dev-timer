# My Film Development Workflow

This is a Next.js project created to help me with my film developing process.

I used to make notes in a little notepad and use my phone's timer, but this wasn’t very practical given the limited space I have—the bathroom sink. So, I created this app to make the process a little easier. Now, I can keep my step-by-step instructions, timers, notes, and usage history all in one place using just one device.

I hope you find it useful too!

## Usage

1. Log in or create an account to start creating your own workflows.
2. See your workflow list or create a new one. Add relevant information and steps (with timers) to help you in your process. Save it, and you can start using your new workflow. I like to add volume mixing in my step descriptions, as it helps with measuring later.
3. Use the timers to complete your development process, and click the finish button to add it to your history with a note. I usually mention details like the temperature I used, in case I decide to edit the workflow later, and about the pictures to help me identify the negative later.
4. View all your completed processes in the History section.
